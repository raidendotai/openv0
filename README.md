**openv0** is a generative UI component framework

It allows you to AI generate and iterate on UI components, with live preview.

- **openv0** makes use of open source component libraries and icons to build a library of assets for the generative pipeline.
- **openv0** is highly modular, and structured for elaborate generative processes
- Component generation is a multipass pipeline - where every pass is a fully independent plugin

# Install

* Open your terminal and run

```sh
npx openv0@latest
```

It will download openv0, configure it based on your choices & install dependencies. Then :

* Start the local server + webapp
  * start server `cd server && node api.js`
  * start webapp `cd webapp && npm run dev`
* Open you web browser, go to `http://localhost:5173/`

That is all. Have fun ðŸŽ‰

**Alternatively** - you can also clone this repo and install manually

To do so :
* Clone repo, run `npm i` in `server/`
* Unzip `server/library/icons/lucide/vectordb/index.zip` into that same folder
* Configure your OpenAI key in `server/.env`
* Web apps starter templates are in `webapps-starters/`
  * run `npm i` in the web app starter of your choice
  * make sure that `WEBAPP_ROOT` variable `server/.env` matches your webapp folder path
* Start the server with `node api.js` and the web app with `npm run dev`

---

**Via Docker** - you can also clone this repo and run via docker (using react as a framework). This will run both server and UI in the same container.

To do so:
* clone and navigate to this repo
* Build the docker image `docker build -f Dockerfile . -t openv0:latest`
* Update the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable in `docker-compose.yaml` with your OAI key
* Choose which webapp starter by updating the `WEBAPP_ROOT` variable in `docker-compose.yaml`
* Run docker compose: `docker-compose up openv0`
* UI should now be accesible at http://localhost:5173
