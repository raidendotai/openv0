# openv0

**openv0** is a generative UI component tool

It allows you to AI generate and iterate on React+Tailwind components, with live preview. openv0 makes use of library components from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and icons from [lucide-icons/lucide](https://lucide.dev/)

The open-source project is inspired by vercel's [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/), which, at the time of writing, is still on private waitlisted alpha
